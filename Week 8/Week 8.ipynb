       " 'Was he, in the\\r\\nmidst of these distractions, these affections which absorbed his life,\\r\\nsuddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which\\r\\nsometimes overwhelm, by striking to his heart, a man whom public\\r\\ncatastrophes would not shake, by striking at his existence and his\\r\\nfortune?',\n",
       " 'No one could have told: all that was known was, that when he\\r\\nreturned from Italy he was a priest.',\n",

       " 'What had been leanness in\\r\\nher youth had become transparency in her maturity; and this diaphaneity\\r\\nallowed the angel to be seen.',\n",
       " 'She was a soul rather than a virgin.',\n",

       " 'Madame Magloire was a little, fat, white old woman, corpulent and\\r\\nbustling; always out of breath,—in the first place, because of her\\r\\nactivity, and in the next, because of her asthma.',\n",

       " 'In the dining-room, a long and superb\\r\\ngallery which was situated on the ground floor and opened on the\\r\\ngardens, M.

       " 'The Bishop cast a glance round the apartment, and seemed to be taking\\r\\nmeasures and calculations with his eyes.',\n",

       " '“The most beautiful of altars,” he said, “is the\\r\\nsoul of an unhappy creature consoled and thanking God.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his oratory there were two straw prie-Dieu, and there was an\\r\\narmchair, also in straw, in his bedroom.',\n",
       " 'When, by chance, he received\\r\\nseven or eight persons at one time, the prefect, or the general, or the\\r\\nstaff of the regiment in garrison, or several pupils from the little\\r\\nseminary, the chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the\\r\\nstable, the prie-Dieu from the oratory, and the armchair from the\\r\\nbedroom: in this way as many as eleven chairs could be collected for\\r\\nthe visitors.',\n",

       " 'At his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen stuff,\\r\\nwhich finally became so old, that, in order to avoid the expense of a\\r\\nnew one, Madame Magloire was forced to take a large seam in the very\\r\\nmiddle of it.',\n",

       " 'Was he, in the\\r\\nmidst of these distractions, these affections which absorbed his life,\\r\\nsuddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which\\r\\nsometimes overwhelm, by striking to his heart, a man whom public\\r\\ncatastrophes would not shake, by striking at his existence and his\\r\\nfortune?',\n",
       " 'No one could have told: all that was known was, that when he\\r\\nreturned from Italy he was a priest.',\n",

       " 'What had been leanness in\\r\\nher youth had become transparency in her maturity; and this diaphaneity\\r\\nallowed the angel to be seen.',\n",
       " 'She was a soul rather than a virgin.',\n",

       " 'Madame Magloire was a little, fat, white old woman, corpulent and\\r\\nbustling; always out of breath,—in the first place, because of her\\r\\nactivity, and in the next, because of her asthma.',\n",

       " 'In the dining-room, a long and superb\\r\\ngallery which was situated on the ground floor and opened on the\\r\\ngardens, M.

       " 'The Bishop cast a glance round the apartment, and seemed to be taking\\r\\nmeasures and calculations with his eyes.',\n",

       " '“The most beautiful of altars,” he said, “is the\\r\\nsoul of an unhappy creature consoled and thanking God.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his oratory there were two straw prie-Dieu, and there was an\\r\\narmchair, also in straw, in his bedroom.',\n",
       " 'When, by chance, he received\\r\\nseven or eight persons at one time, the prefect, or the general, or the\\r\\nstaff of the regiment in garrison, or several pupils from the little\\r\\nseminary, the chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the\\r\\nstable, the prie-Dieu from the oratory, and the armchair from the\\r\\nbedroom: in this way as many as eleven chairs could be collected for\\r\\nthe visitors.',\n",

       " 'At his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen stuff,\\r\\nwhich finally became so old, that, in order to avoid the expense of a\\r\\nnew one, Madame Magloire was forced to take a large seam in the very\\r\\nmiddle of it.',\n",
